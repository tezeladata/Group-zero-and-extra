The printf function returns the number of characters transmitted, or a negative value if
an output or encoding error occurred.

The printf function is equivalent to fprintf with the argument stdout interposed
before the arguments to printf.

Input and output, whether to or from physical devices such as terminals and tape drives,
or whether to or from files supported on structured storage devices, are mapped into
logical data streams, whose properties are more uniform than their various inputs and
outputs. Two forms of mapping are supported, for text streams and for binary
streams.

FILE
which is an object type capable of recording all the information needed to control a
stream, including its file position indicator, a pointer to its associated buffer (if any), an
error indicator that records whether a read/write error has occurred, and an end-of-file
indicator that records whether the end of the file has been reached;

stdin, stfout, stferr - all of them are macros


 The getchar function is equivalent to getc with the argument stdin.
