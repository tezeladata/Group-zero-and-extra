            The First Crusade  was the first of a series of religious wars, or Crusades,<br> 
            initiated, supported and at times directed by the Latin Church in the medieval period.<br>
            The objective was the recovery of the Holy Land from Islamic rule.

            The First Crusade began in 1096 and concluded in 1099. <br>
            It was initiated in response to the Byzantine Emperor<br>
            Alexios I Komnenos' call for military aid against the Seljuk Turks<br>
            and the desire to recapture Jerusalem from Muslim control.<br>
            The main military campaigns occurred between 1096 and 1099,<br>
            culminating in the capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders on July 15, 1099.
