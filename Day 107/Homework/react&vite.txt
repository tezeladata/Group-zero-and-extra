React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components by Facebook Inc. 
It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.  Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, 
React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. 
A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements. We call that virtual DOM

React code is made of entities called components.â€ŠThese components are modular and reusable.
React applications typically consist of many layers of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the DOM using the React DOM library. 
When rendering a component, values are passed between components through props (short for "properties"). Values internal to a component are called its state.


Vite (French: vit) is a local development server written by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, and used by default by Vue and for React project templates. 
It has support for TypeScript and JSX. It uses Rollup and esbuild internally for bundling.

It monitors files as they're being edited and upon file save the web browser reloads the code being edited through a process called Hot Module Replacement 
which works by just reloading the specific file being changed using ES6 modules (ESM) instead of recompiling the entire application.

Vite provides built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR). By default, it listens on TCP port 5173. 
It is possible to configure Vite to serve content over HTTPS and proxy requests (including WebSocket) to a back-end web server (such as Apache HTTP Server or lighttpd).
