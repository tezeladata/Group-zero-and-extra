// React is library created by Meta
// React is known for it's fast pace, efficiency and flexibility
// We simply write user interface using React
// User interface is frontend

// Component is part of website that contains info about itself
// Component is like function but returns jsx
// Component can be divided into components
// Main component is always called App

// jsx stands for js xml
// jsx allows us to write html like code in js

// babel allows us to change syntaxes

// We can create hard interfaces with easy syntax using React
// React is efficient and fast, because it uses virtual DOM
// When we use vanilla js and make some little change, whole website renders
// But when we use react and make some little change, virtual DOM only renders one component

// useState is hook that creates current state of code
// useState has variable and function
// We have to manually give signal for website to render component again

// vite is developer tool and is super important
// After using vite, we can also use React
// vite configures everything automatically
