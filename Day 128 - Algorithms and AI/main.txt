macro invocation - If the identifier-list in the macro definition does not end with an ellipsis, the number of
arguments (including those arguments consisting of no preprocessing tokens) in an
invocation of a function-like macro shall equal the number of parameters in the macro
definition. Otherwise, there shall be more arguments in the invocation than there are
parameters in the macro definition (excluding the ...). There shall exist a )
preprocessing token that terminates the invocation.

byte - addressable unit of data storage large enough to hold any member of the basic character
set of the execution environment


Both the basic source and basic execution character sets shall have the following
members: the 26 uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet
the 26 lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet
the 10 decimal digits

type - The meaning of a value stored in an object or returned by a function is determined by the
type of the expression used to access it. (An identifier declared to be an object is the
simplest such expression; the type is specified in the declaration of the identifier.) Types
are partitioned into object types (types that describe objects) and function types (types
that describe functions).

main function - The function called at program startup is named main. The implementation declares no
prototype for this function. It shall be defined with a return type of int and with no
parameters


The printf function returns the number of characters transmitted, or a negative value if
an output or encoding error occurred.

The printf function is equivalent to fprintf with the argument stdout interposed
before the arguments to printf.
