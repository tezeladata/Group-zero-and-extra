        <p>
            <b>Tornike Eristavi</b> (Georgian: თორნიკე ერისთავი) also known as <b>John Tornike</b> (died in 985) was a retired<br> 
            Georgian general and monk who came to be better known as a founder of the formerly Georgian Orthodox <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Iviron">Iviron Monastery</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Athos">Mount Athos</a> in the modern-day northeastern Greece.

        <h2>Life</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Tornike came from a notable Georgian noble family and was in the immediate circles of the ruling dynasty of<br> 
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagrationi_dynasty">Bagrationi</a> His father, Chordvaneli, had been in the suite of the Georgian prince <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashot_II_of_Tao">Ashot II Kuropalates</a>  who<br>
            had paid a visit to the Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogennetos in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople">Constantinople</a>  in c. 950. Three<br>
            of his nephews had military careers and one of them, Varazvache, held a post of katepano (military governor)<br> 
            of the significant Byzantine eastern outpost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edessa">Edessa</a> in 1037–8.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tornike served a very successful military and court career (specifically he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eristavi">eristavi</a>, a Georgian equivalent <br>
            to strategos) under the Georgian Bagratid dynasty and also gained the Byzantine title of patrikios. He <br>
            resigned his position as a general of the Georgian prince <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_III_of_Tao">David III of Tao</a> in c. 963 and, under the name of <br>
            Ioane (Ioannis, or John), retired to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_the_Athonite">Athanasius</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lavra">Lavra</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Athos">Mount Athos</a>. He was joined, in the early 970s, by <br>
            another retired Georgian officer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Iberian">Ioane</a> and his son <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthymius_the_Athonite">Ek'vt'ime</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 976, a rebellion led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardas_Skleros">Bardas Skleros</a> broke out in the Asian provinces of the Byzantine Empire, the <br>
            greatest upheaval of the emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_II">Basil II’s</a> early reign. Skleros had won a series of battles against the then- <br>
            loyal general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardas_Phokas_the_Younger">Bardas Phokas</a> and marched from the east through Anatolia to Constantinople. Basil <br>
            summoned John-Tornike to his capital to mediate the alliance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_III_of_Tao">David III of Tao</a>, a measure that seemed to <br>
            be necessary to save the situation. The monk agreed reluctantly, persuaded chiefly by his fellow monks that it <br>
            would be in the best interests of the Athonite community for him to obey the imperial command. David <br>
            responded vigorously and entrusted his former general the command of some 12,000 Georgian cavalrymen <br>
            sent to reinforce the imperial army. The decisive battle was fought at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pankaleia">Pankalia</a> near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarea_(Mazaca)">Caesarea</a> on March 24, <br>
            979 and resulted in the crushing defeat of the rebels.

        <h2>Founding of Iviron monastery</h2>

        <p>
            In reward for their support, David was awarded with the lifetime stewardship of the extensive lands in northeastern <br>
            Anatolia, while John-Tornike was conferred with the title synkellos (assistant to the patriarch of Constantinople). <br>
            More importantly, the victorious monk-general returned to Athos laden with the spoils of war, "precious objects" <br>
            as well as twelve kentenaria (1,200 lb) of gold, that enabled the Georgians to establish their own house on Athos, <br>
            called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Iviron">Iviron</a>. Although populated now with Greeks, the monastery is to this day known by the Greek appellation Iviron, <br>
            "of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Iberia">Iberians</a>", i.e., Georgians. The emperor also showered him with lands and privileges, granted him subsidies and <br>
            exemption from taxes. The new monastic house, destined to become a vibrant center of the Georgian Orthodox culture, was <br>
            jointly run by John-Tornike as ktetor (founder) and his friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Iberian">John the Iberian</a> as hegoumenos (abbot).
