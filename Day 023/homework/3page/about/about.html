        <h1>History of Programming languages</h1>
        <p>
            The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers<br> 
            to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized,<br>
            relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax.<br>
            Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of <br>
            high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.
