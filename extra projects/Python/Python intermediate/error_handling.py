# In programming, bugs and errors are common, regardless of experience level. They can range from minor typos to complex logical errors. 

# salary = 50000
# role = Analyst
# age -> 29 #error here
# print(salary)

# Mistakes in Python can be broadly categorized into two types: bugs and exceptions.
data = ["anna", "bob", "mery"]
names = [x.capitalize() for x in data] #capitalize instead of upper
print(names)

# Exceptions are another category of mistakes in programming. 
#  These are specific errors that occur during a program's execution and interrupt its normal flow when first encountered.

# There are different types of exceptions in python.
# NameError is raised when variable is not defined:
# print(surname)

# SyntaxError is raised when there is invalid syntax:
# name => "David"

# IndexError is raised when you call invalid index
# print(data[7])

# The TypeError exception is raised when a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type. 
# grade=10
# print(len(grade))

# The ValueError exception is raised when a function receives a value of the correct type, but the value itself is inappropriate or unacceptable.
# new_str = "abc123"
# print(int(new_str))
