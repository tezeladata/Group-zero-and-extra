        <h1>Programming language</h1>
        <p>
            A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.<br>
            A programming language is usually described in terms of its syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). <br>
            These are usually defined by a formal language. <br>
            A language usually has at least one implementation in the form of a compiler or interpreter, <br>
            allowing programs written in the language to be executed.
